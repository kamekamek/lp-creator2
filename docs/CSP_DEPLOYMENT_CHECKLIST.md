# CSP Security Enhancement Deployment Checklist

## ðŸ”’ Pre-Deployment Security Review

### âœ… Code Review Checklist

- [ ] **Remove all `'unsafe-inline'` directives** from CSP configurations
- [ ] **Verify nonce generation** uses cryptographically secure randomness
- [ ] **Validate CSP header generation** produces correct syntax
- [ ] **Test nonce injection** into HTML content
- [ ] **Confirm violation reporting** endpoint is functional
- [ ] **Review middleware implementation** for security headers
- [ ] **Validate environment-specific configurations** (dev vs prod)

### âœ… Security Testing

- [ ] **XSS Prevention Test**: Inject malicious scripts and verify they're blocked
- [ ] **Nonce Validation Test**: Verify only nonce-authorized content executes
- [ ] **CSP Violation Test**: Confirm violations are properly reported
- [ ] **External Resource Test**: Verify trusted CDNs still work
- [ ] **Inline Content Test**: Confirm legitimate inline content works with nonces

## ðŸš€ Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Report-Only Mode (Week 1-2)

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env.production
CSP_ENFORCE=false
CSP_REPORT_ONLY=true
CSP_REPORT_URI=/api/csp-report
DEBUG_CSP=false
```

#### Deployment Steps
- [ ] **Deploy with report-only CSP** to production
- [ ] **Monitor violation reports** for 48-72 hours
- [ ] **Analyze violation patterns** and identify issues
- [ ] **Fix any legitimate violations** (missing nonces, etc.)
- [ ] **Validate no functional regressions** reported by users

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero functional regressions reported
- [ ] Violation reports show only expected/malicious attempts
- [ ] All legitimate inline content has proper nonces
- [ ] External resources load correctly

### Phase 2: Gradual Enforcement (Week 3-4)

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env.production
CSP_ENFORCE=true
CSP_REPORT_ONLY=false
STRICT_CSP_MODE=false  # Allow some fallbacks initially
```

#### Deployment Steps
- [ ] **Enable CSP enforcement** on low-traffic pages first
- [ ] **Monitor for 24 hours** before expanding scope
- [ ] **Gradually expand** to high-traffic pages
- [ ] **Maintain violation monitoring** throughout rollout
- [ ] **Have rollback plan** ready if issues arise

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] No increase in error rates or user complaints
- [ ] CSP violations limited to actual attack attempts
- [ ] Performance metrics remain stable
- [ ] Security monitoring shows improved protection

### Phase 3: Full Enforcement (Week 5+)

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env.production
CSP_ENFORCE=true
CSP_REPORT_ONLY=false
STRICT_CSP_MODE=true
CSP_UPGRADE_INSECURE=true
CSP_BLOCK_MIXED_CONTENT=true
```

#### Deployment Steps
- [ ] **Enable full CSP enforcement** across all pages
- [ ] **Activate strict mode** with no fallbacks
- [ ] **Enable additional security features** (HSTS, mixed content blocking)
- [ ] **Set up automated monitoring** and alerting
- [ ] **Document security improvements** for compliance

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete elimination of XSS attack surface
- [ ] Security audit shows A+ rating
- [ ] Compliance requirements met
- [ ] Zero security incidents related to inline content
