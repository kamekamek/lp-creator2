# Changelog

All notable changes to the LP Creator platform will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **TypeScript Compatibility**: Updated timer type definitions in `InlineTextEditor.tsx` to use `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` instead of `NodeJS.Timeout` for better cross-platform compatibility between browser and Node.js environments
- **Documentation**: Updated technical documentation to reflect TypeScript improvements and cross-platform compatibility considerations

### Technical Details
- Replaced `NodeJS.Timeout` with `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` in timeout ref declarations
- This change ensures the component works correctly in both browser and server-side rendering contexts
- No functional changes to the editing system behavior
